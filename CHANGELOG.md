# Changelog

## v4.2.4 - 2026-05-14

Model routing persistence fix.

### Fixed

- Preserved Model Routing and Codex Model selections when clicking Save Config after editing the selected model.
- Kept route selections synchronized when a model ID is renamed, instead of letting the model list refresh revert to stale saved values.

## v4.1.1 - 2026-05-13

GUI interaction polish release.

### Fixed

- Kept Advanced / Optional action buttons in the right-side area while aligning them vertically in the compact card.
- Prevented combo boxes from changing values on mouse wheel unless the dropdown list is explicitly open.

## v4.1.0 - 2026-05-13

Stable PyQt5 iOS-style GUI release.

### Changed

- Prevented combo boxes from changing values on mouse wheel unless the control is focused or opened.
- Tightened the Advanced / Optional card and improved button alignment.
- Switched Models to a table-style view with headers, row selection, grid lines, and alternating rows.
- Replaced the application icon with the transparent `myImage2` icon.
- Promoted the accepted PyQt5 GUI preview to the stable 4.1.0 release.

## v4.0.5-preview - 2026-05-13

iOS-style PyQt5 GUI preview.

### Changed

- Rebuilt the preview GUI with PyQt5 while preserving the existing SHTUCodeProxy workflow.
- Added iOS-inspired QSS styling with system gray background, metallic navigation bar, glass cards, rounded controls, and blue-white accent colors.
- Added real `QGraphicsDropShadowEffect` shadows on cards and focus glow effects on text inputs.

## v4.0.4-preview - 2026-05-13

Metallic Apple-inspired GUI preview refinement.

### Changed

- Updated the preview to SHTUCodeProxy 4.0.4.
- Switched the preview canvas to pure white and tuned the surrounding palette to pearl white, soft blue, and silver.
- Reduced gray-looking controls by using blue-tinted comboboxes plus raised white/silver button surfaces with stronger relief.

## v3.5.1 - 2026-05-13

User safety and recovery workflow release.

### Added

- Added a red warning confirmation for Codex `danger-full-access` sandbox mode.
- Added connection status showing whether the configured port is not listening, externally listening, or started by this app.
- Added recovery buttons for restoring the most recent client backup or the original client config for both Claude Code and Codex modes.
- Added Codex health check for TOML syntax, auth mode, provider/profile, hooks, sandbox, project entries, and MCP server preservation.

### Fixed

- Captured original client config snapshots before first managed writes, including the case where the original file did not exist.
- Improved the GUI workflow so users can see connection state and recover broken client config without manually searching backup files.

## v3.2.25 - 2026-05-13

Codex config preservation hardening release.

### Fixed

- Preserved unmanaged Codex root settings, MCP server blocks, unrelated profiles, project trust entries, and other Codex tables while still replacing the SHTU proxy provider/profile cleanly.
- Added recovery for partially corrupted config files where stale root `model` or `model_provider` lines had been inserted under unrelated tables.
- Preserved non-deprecated feature flags and Windows settings while migrating `codex_hooks` to `hooks`.

## v3.2.24 - 2026-05-13

Codex sandbox configuration release.

### Added

- Added a Codex Sandbox selector next to Codex Model with `read-only`, `workspace-write`, and `danger-full-access` options.

### Fixed

- Migrated deprecated `[features].codex_hooks` to `[features].hooks` and removed stale `codex_hooks` entries during config rewrites.
- Preserved idempotent Codex config writes so repeated Save Config, Write Client Config, or Save + Connect clicks do not duplicate root keys, feature flags, provider blocks, or profiles.

## v3.2.23 - 2026-05-12

Release packaging consistency update.

### Changed

- Restored the full five-asset release packaging convention: Windows single-file EXE, Windows portable ZIP, Linux/macOS source ZIP, release README, and SHA256 checksums.
- Versioned the Windows portable ZIP asset so each GitHub release contains self-contained package names.

### Security

- Source release packaging only copies git-tracked files and excludes local config files, API keys, backups, probe outputs, and build directories.

## v3.2.22 - 2026-05-12

Codex Windows shell compatibility release.

### Fixed

- Matched CC switch behavior by preserving or forcing `[windows] sandbox = "elevated"` for Codex configs on Windows while keeping `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"`.
- Normalized Codex shell tool aliases such as `shell_exec`, `exec_command`, and `bash` to `shell`.
- Converted shell string commands and bare argv commands such as `echo` into PowerShell argv arrays so Codex's Windows shell schema can execute them.

## v3.2.21 - 2026-05-12

Codex sandbox path case preservation release.

### Fixed

- Preserved original `[projects...]` TOML table headers exactly when rewriting Codex `config.toml`, including path case and quoting style.
- Added regression coverage for mixed-case sandbox/project paths so Codex authorization path matching is not broken by config rewrites.

## v3.2.20 - 2026-05-12

Dual-client tool-chain validation release.

### Added

- Added `claude_path_probe.py` to validate Claude Code `/v1/messages` with real multi-turn, multi-tool, and tool-switching scenarios.
- Expanded `api_deep_probe.py` to validate Codex `/v1/responses` multi-turn context, multiple tools, tool-result follow-up, streaming tool calls, and switching from file-read to directory-list tools.

### Verified

- Verified `glm-chat`, `deepseek-chat`, and `qwen-instruct` across Claude Code and Codex protocol paths using real upstream calls.
- Confirmed Claude Code returns standard Anthropic `tool_use` for implicit file-reading requests.
- Confirmed Codex returns Responses `function_call` for implicit file-reading, multi-tool, streamed-tool, and follow-up tool-result requests.

## v3.0.14 - 2026-05-12

Codex autonomous tool-call compatibility release.

### Fixed

- Added a short Chat Completions system hint telling local models to use native `tool_calls` instead of writing XML or pseudo tool-call text.
- Converted common pseudo tool-call formats (`<function>`, `<call>`, `<read_file>`, `<exec_command>`, `<Invoke>`, `<shell>`, and `<tool_invoke>`) into real Responses `function_call` outputs for Codex.
- Coerced pseudo shell commands into Codex's actual shell schema with `command` as an argument array, reducing unsupported-call and invalid-argument failures.
- Stripped pseudo `<tool_results>` blocks from model-visible text so fake tool results do not appear as final answers.

## v3.0.13 - 2026-05-12

Multi-round Codex tool-chain validation release.

### Fixed

- Added a visible `<tool_result>` fallback when converting Codex `function_call_output` history to Chat Completions messages, improving GLM's ability to use tool results across turns.
- Verified real proxy scenarios for normal chat, single tool call, multi-tool call, streamed tool call, and tool-result follow-up across `glm-chat`, `deepseek-chat`, and `qwen-instruct`.
- Added `api_deep_probe.py` to exercise Codex/MCP/skills-equivalent Responses tool flows against the local proxy with real upstream models.

## v3.0.12 - 2026-05-12

Codex tool-call forwarding fix release.

### Fixed

- Parsed per-model API keys from `D:\litellm\api.txt` so `glm-chat`, `deepseek-chat`, and `qwen-instruct` do not accidentally share the first GLM token.
- Fixed non-streaming Codex `/v1/responses` requests through Chat Completions routes to call upstream with `stream=false` and convert JSON `tool_calls` directly into Responses `function_call` output.
- Upstream JSON error responses now become proxy errors instead of silent successful Responses payloads with empty `output`.
- Verified real direct and proxied tool-call calls for `glm-chat`, `deepseek-chat`, and `qwen-instruct`, including streaming Responses events used by Codex.

## v3.0.11 - 2026-05-12

Codex config repair release.

### Fixed

- Improved config writing fallback for protected `.codex` paths and documented that writes must run outside the Codex sandbox identity.
- Built-in routes now include `glm-chat`, `deepseek-chat`, and `qwen-instruct` from `D:\litellm\api.txt` so Codex model switching has matching proxy routes.
- CLI `write-codex-config` now accepts `--model` for switching Codex model without opening the GUI.
- Codex config writing now preserves the selected `Codex Model` instead of forcing `glm-chat`; GLM remains an optional route.
- GUI and CLI server startup now try to stop an existing Windows listener on the configured port before starting a fresh proxy.
- Codex config writer now emits a clean minimal config instead of preserving stale sections that can make Codex ignore the custom provider/profile and fall back to `api.openai.com`.
- Config backup/write now falls back to the project `backups` directory when `.codex` ACLs deny same-directory backup or temp-file creation.
- Default Codex setup now switches to the local `shtu_proxy` provider with `glm-chat` routed through the proxy instead of leaving old direct `custom` provider settings in place.
- Added persisted `glm-chat` Chat Completions routing for the ShanghaiTech `/api/v1/start` endpoint when writing Codex setup.
- Verified GLM `/start` tool calls and added regression coverage for GLM streamed `tool_calls` argument merging.
- Codex `config.toml` writer now places root `model` and `model_provider` before the first TOML section instead of appending them into the last section.
- Repeated Save + Connect clicks now remove stale duplicated `shtu_proxy` model keys that older builds could leave inside sections such as `[tui.model_availability_nux]`.
- Config writers now validate generated JSON/TOML before replacing files and keep timestamped `.bak_*` backups of existing config files.
- Codex provider no longer writes `env_key`, avoiding startup failures when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set as a process environment variable.
- Codex `auth.json` now writes `auth_mode = apikey` alongside `OPENAI_API_KEY`, matching `codex login --with-api-key` output while preserving unrelated existing fields.

## v3.0.1 - 2026-05-12

Codex setup polish and GUI guidance release.

### Added

- Independent Codex model selection in GUI and config persistence.
- Codex root `model` and `model_provider` writing so users do not have to manually select a profile.
- Red warning in Model Config: GPT models should use `API Format = responses`.

### Fixed

- Codex `auth.json` now follows the selected Codex model instead of the Claude main route.
- Older configs missing Codex paths are normalized when the GUI starts.

- Responses-to-Chat-Completions conversion for local models that only expose Chat Completions-compatible APIs.
- Codex `config.toml` example with `wire_api = "responses"`.
- GUI `Client Mode` switch for Claude Code vs Codex CLI/Desktop setup.
- Independent GUI `Codex Model` selector for `config.toml` profile and `auth.json` key selection.
- Codex `config.toml` writer that preserves unrelated config and replaces only the `shtu_proxy` provider/profile blocks.
- Codex `auth.json` writer with `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the selected upstream model key.
- Smoke coverage for multi-turn Codex context, multi-tool definitions, streamed/non-streamed function calls, `function_call_output` history, DSML/thinking filtering, and model routing.

### Changed

- The project now documents Claude Code and Codex as separate client protocols using the same model routing table while preserving the v2.0 Claude Code setup path.
- Version bumped to `3.0.0`.

## v2.0.0 - 2026-04-30

Tool-call hardening release for Claude Code compatibility.

### Added

- Broader smoke-test coverage for multiple tool calls, cumulative streamed arguments, model suffix routing, and tool argument repair.
- Estimated `/count_tokens` responses instead of a fixed zero count.

### Changed

- Hardened Chat Completions and Responses tool-call parsing for streamed and non-streamed upstream responses.
- Improved `tool_result` ordering and visible fallback context for Chat Completions-compatible upstreams.
- Claude model routing now accepts common date-suffixed model IDs.
- GPT-series models are documented to use the `responses` API Format.

### Fixed

- Chat Completions responses that include both `content` and `tool_calls` now prioritize tool calls instead of dropping them.
- Tool arguments wrapped in JSON strings, markdown fences, thinking tags, or cumulative streamed snapshots are repaired more reliably.
- Multiple tool calls in one upstream chunk are no longer dropped.

## v1.9.0 - 2026-04-28

Claude Code tool-call compatibility release.

### Added

- Bidirectional tool-call translation between Anthropic `tool_use/tool_result` and upstream Chat Completions `tool_calls`.

- Streaming conversion from upstream tool-call events into Anthropic-style `tool_use` content blocks.
- Smoke-test coverage for tool schema conversion, tool history conversion, streamed tool-call deltas, and `stop_reason: tool_use`.

### Changed

- Tool schemas are now sent as real upstream tools instead of text-only context notes.
- Tool results are now preserved as structured tool outputs instead of plain text fallbacks.
## v1.8.0 - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Renamed GUI field `Responses Base URL` to `Base URL`.
- Changed default API Format to `chat_completions`.
- Changed default Base URL to `https://genaiapi.shanghaitech.edu.cn/api/v1/start`.
